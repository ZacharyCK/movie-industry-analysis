## Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment is a best practice for Python development. It allows you to manage project dependencies separately from your global Python installation. Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Check your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

### Creating the Virtual Environment

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Open your terminal and navigate to the root of your project directory.

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project

1. **Create Virtual Environment**:

    - For Windows
    ```
    python -m venv venv
